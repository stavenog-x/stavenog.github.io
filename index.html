<h2><font face="times new roman" >Welcome to My Page</font></h2>
<body><font face="arial">
    My name is Grayson Stavenow and I am a student at McMaster University.
    I have been playing competetive card games for over a decade now! 
    My other hobbies include competetive video games, I even played for the McMaster VALORANT and Counter Strike 2 teams.
    I enjoy competetive games due to the critical thinking and pace of competetive games, and it has improved my mental fortitude as well as ability to act under pressure.
